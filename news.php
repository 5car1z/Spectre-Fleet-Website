                For the last two years Spectre Fleet has existed as a channel based community dedicated to hosting public PvP fleets that anyone and everyone can join. What started as a small group of friends running the occasional cruiser fleet has since grown into the largest and most active public community in the entire game. We’ve camped gates, killed supers, and flown everything from destroyers to faction battleships with triage - all without a parent corporation or alliance.
				</p><p>
				However, there are limitations to what we can accomplish as a channel based community. So today, I’m proud to announce the future of the NPSI playstyle - the Spectre Fleet Alliance!
				</p><p>
				No, the Spectre Fleet channel is not shutting down, and no, we are not going to stop running public fleets. However, a large number of people who participate in the NPSI communities rely on these groups for the entirety of their PvP content, and we want to provide a home to those players who may not have one otherwise.  Also, the format of Spectre Fleet currently favors large fleets, and small gang PvP is generally impossible. It would be nice to provide an outlet for people to conduct small gang or solo PvP while in the same social environment. No blues, no structure grinds, no sov warfare, no politics... just good old fashioned spaceship combat.
				</p><p>
				That’s our promise to you.
				</p><p>
				We want this alliance to be a home for anyone who is passionate about PvP, whether you’re a brand new player with lots to learn, or a bittervet with more skillpoints than brains. Now, joining this alliance won’t put you on the fast track to PL, nor will it allow you to rat safely in Deklein, but at least we can promise that you’ll never have to grind sov in Atrons. What makes the Spectre Fleet Alliance unique? Simple. This alliance will operate using the same NPSI rules of engagement we always have! If you’re not in fleet, you’ll be considered a valid target regardless of whether you’re red, neutral, blue, or green.

				For more information, check out our website or join the in-game channel Spectre Fleet. If you’d like to join as an individual, either contact the recruiters of any corporation within the Alliance or wait until we create a Spectre Fleet Corporation. (SoonTM!) If you’d like to join as a Corporation, please contact Jayne Fillon for details and requirements. If you currently partake in Spectre Fleet activities through our channel and are happy with the Alliance or Corporation you are currently a part of, then nothing will change for you.
				</p><p>
				All of Spectre Fleet’s major events and activities will remain open to the general public.
