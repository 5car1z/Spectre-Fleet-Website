                                <h3>Simple, but effective.</h3>
                                <p>This is where it all started. &quot;Classic Cruisers&quot; was used for the first time in December of 2013, two weeks before the official formation of Spectre Fleet. This is simple doctrine that relies on the high tank and gank of the Moa to outlast the opponent. Best used in lowsec, and a great doctrine for Junior Fleet Commanders due to the low FC workload.</p>

                                <p>A very niche and difficult doctine to command, Longbows can easily wreak havok from long range on unsuspecting fleets, and instantly vaporize frigates regardless of where they are located on grid. However, get caught out of position even for a moment, and prepare yourself for a quick trip back to station. This doctrine is meant to third party major engagements, rather than fight another fleet one on one.</p>

                            <p>This fleet doctrine takes the concept of &quot;more tank more gank&quot; to the absolute extreme. Removing the propulsion modules normally found on combat ships, and replacing them with extra shield modules, the resulting ship is completely immobile, but very difficult to kill. Equipped with artillery cannons, a coordinated volley can and will destroy anything it is aimed at. Not recommended for nullsec usage.</p>
